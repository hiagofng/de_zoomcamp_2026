Datatalks homeworks and exercises for DE Zoomcamp 2026

📚 Course Progress
✅ Module 1: Containerization and Infrastructure as Code
Status: Completed | Folder: 01-docker-terraform/

What I learned:

Docker fundamentals - Container lifecycle, volumes, and data persistence
Docker networking - Container communication and port mapping
Docker Compose - Multi-service orchestration (PostgreSQL + pgAdmin)
Data pipelines - NYC Taxi data ingestion using Python, pandas, and SQLAlchemy
SQL queries - Data analysis on PostgreSQL databases
Terraform for GCP - Infrastructure as Code for Google Cloud (Storage + BigQuery)
Terraform for AWS - Equivalent AWS infrastructure (S3 + Glue Catalog)
Best practices - Environment variables, .gitignore for credentials, and project structure
Key deliverables:

Homework 01 - Docker, SQL, and Terraform exercises ✅
Working PostgreSQL + pgAdmin environment via Docker Compose
Python data ingestion scripts for parquet and CSV files
Terraform configurations for GCP and AWS resource provisioning
Technologies used: Docker, PostgreSQL, pgAdmin, Python, pandas, SQLAlchemy, Terraform, GCP, AWS

Cloud Service Comparison - GCP vs AWS:

GCP Service	AWS Equivalent	Purpose
Google Cloud Storage (GCS)	Amazon S3	Data Lake storage
Uniform Bucket Level Access	S3 Public Access Block	Secure bucket access
Object Lifecycle Rules	S3 Lifecycle Configuration	Automatic data expiration
BigQuery Dataset	AWS Glue Catalog Database	Metadata & query layer
Service Account JSON Key	IAM User Profile (AWS CLI)	Authentication
Authentication Difference:

GCP: Requires my-creds.json service account key file
AWS: Uses IAM profile from ~/.aws/credentials (no separate file needed)
✅ Module 2: Workflow Orchestration
Status: Completed | Folder: 02-workflow-orchestration/

What I learned:

Kestra fundamentals - Modern declarative workflow orchestration platform
ETL pipeline orchestration - Extract, transform, and load NYC taxi data to GCP
Variables and expressions - Dynamic workflow configuration using Jinja templating
Backfill functionality - Historical data processing for multiple time periods
Scheduled triggers - Automated workflow execution with timezone support
GCP integration - Cloud Storage and BigQuery data loading
Secrets management - Secure credential handling with base64 encoding
Docker Compose orchestration - Multi-service setup (Kestra + PostgreSQL + pgAdmin)
Key deliverables:

Homework 02 - Workflow orchestration and data pipeline exercises ✅
Working Kestra instance with PostgreSQL backend via Docker Compose
Automated ETL flows processing millions of taxi trip records
GCP bucket and BigQuery dataset created via Terraform-like flows
Backfill executions for all 2020 data (Yellow: 24.6M rows, Green: 1.7M rows)
Technologies used: Kestra, Docker, PostgreSQL, Python, GCP (Cloud Storage + BigQuery), Gemini AI

Kestra Workflow Highlights:

Flow	Purpose	Data Processed
08_gcp_taxi	Manual ETL execution	Single month of taxi data
09_gcp_taxi_scheduled	Scheduled ETL with backfill	Multiple months via cron triggers
06_gcp_kv	Configuration management	Stores GCP project settings
07_gcp_setup	Infrastructure provisioning	Creates GCS bucket + BigQuery dataset
Data Pipeline Results:

Yellow Taxi (2020): 24,648,499 records across 12 months
Green Taxi (2020): 1,734,051 records across 12 months
Yellow Taxi (March 2021): 1,925,152 records
File size example: 128.3 MiB uncompressed CSV for Dec 2020
🔄 Module 3: Data Warehouse
Status: Not Started | Folder: 03-data-warehouse/

Coming soon...
